# Multi-Chatbot-Playground
Multi-Model Q&amp;A Chatbot with GROQ is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to interact with multiple GROQ-powered language models simultaneously. It provides a side-by-side comparison of responses from different models like Gemma2-9B, LLaMA 3.1-8B, and GPT-OSS-20B, making it ideal for evaluating model performance and behavior.
